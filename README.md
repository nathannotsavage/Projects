Overview

This project investigates how the placement of products within a retail store—along with other key variables such as pricing, competitor pricing, promotional efforts, foot traffic, seasonal timing, and demographics—influences sales volume. The analysis provides data-driven insights into which factors most significantly drive product performance, with a focus on optimizing store layout strategies and promotional planning.


Why This Data?


Retailers constantly seek ways to maximize sales through smart product positioning and pricing. I chose this dataset because it offers a multifaceted look into a real-world retail challenge: How can we optimize shelf space and store layout to increase revenue? The dataset simulates realistic variables that retail managers deal with every day, such as:

Front-of-store vs. end-cap vs. aisle placement

Price elasticity and competitor comparisons

Seasonal demand fluctuations

Demographic targeting

Promotional effects

This made it an ideal dataset to explore business decision-making through data analysis.


Methodology


I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualized relationships between variables using tools like Tableau and MySql Key steps included:

Cleaning and preparing categorical data for analysis

Comparing sales volume across different product positions

Evaluating the impact of pricing and promotions

Assessing how foot traffic levels and seasonal timing influence outcomes

Segmenting sales performance by consumer demographics and product category


Key Findings


End-cap positioning showed consistently higher sales volume across product categories, supporting the idea that visibility and ease of access strongly influence buyer behavior.

Promotions had a noticeable effect: promoted items performed better regardless of position, but had the largest impact when placed on end-caps or at the front of the store.

Foot traffic was positively correlated with sales, particularly for non-seasonal and electronic products.

Price and competitor price played a significant role in sales, but price sensitivity varied by product type and demographic group.

Seasonal products benefited from both front-of-store positioning and timely promotional efforts, showing strong lift in high-traffic periods.


Conclusion and Recommendations


Retailers should strongly consider prioritizing end-cap space and front-of-store real estate for high-margin or seasonal items, particularly when combined with targeted promotions. Foot traffic patterns and demographic insights can further guide optimal product placement. Additionally, dynamic pricing strategies should take into account competitor pricing and product category sensitivity.
